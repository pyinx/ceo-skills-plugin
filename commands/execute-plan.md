description: "Resume CEO workflow from existing task plan. Continues development from current phase."
---

Read the current task plan from `.claudedocs/task_plan.md` to determine current phase.

Execute the appropriate phase directly:

**Phase 4 (开发实现)**:
- Extract development tasks from architecture
- Invoke subagent-driven-development for task execution
- Use two-stage code review for quality

**Phase 5 (测试验证)**:
- Generate comprehensive tests
- Use parallel-dispatch for independent test failure fixes

**Phase 6 (交付部署)**:
- Create deployment documentation
- Generate user manuals and promotion materials

⚠️ Continue workflow execution directly based on task plan state.
