Execute the brainstorming exploration process:

1. Ask probing questions to uncover hidden requirements
2. Explore user's vision through collaborative dialogue
3. Identify constraints, preferences, and success criteria
4. Generate structured requirements brief when complete

⚠️ This is requirements discovery - execute the exploration directly, do not invoke additional skills or commands.
