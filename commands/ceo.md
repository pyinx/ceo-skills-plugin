description: "Launch CEO workflow orchestrator: coordinates 6 specialized agents (product, design, architecture, development, testing, marketing) with Superpowers framework integration. Auto-manages development from requirements exploration through deployment."
---

Execute the CEO orchestrator workflow:

1. Check for existing `.claudedocs/task_plan.md` to resume or start new workflow
2. Follow the 6-phase development process as documented in the skill
3. Use Superpowers framework skills (brainstorming, git-worktrees, subagent-driven-dev, parallel-dispatch) at appropriate phases
4. Maintain task plan state and progress tracking throughout

⚠️ This is an orchestrator - execute the workflow steps directly, do not re-invoke this command or skill.
