description: "Create implementation plan from architecture design. Use when architecture design is complete and you need to break down into implementation tasks."
---

Read the architecture design document from `.claudedocs/ceo-system-architect_result.md`.

Then update the task plan at `.claudedocs/task_plan.md` by extracting all development tasks from the architecture document and organizing them into 2-5 minute subtasks.

Follow the ceo skill's Step 8.2 (Extract development tasks and create TodoWrite) for the exact methodology.
